                    <p class="wow fadeInDown" data-wow-delay="0.2s">Conceived by Briac Pinault, President of the HEC MBA Student Council in 1991, the organizers of the inaugural HEC MBA Tournament sought to promote HEC Paris globally in the context of a sporting event. </p>

                    <p class="wow fadeInDown" data-wow-delay="0.2s">Set against the idyllic backdrop of HEC’s campus and utilizing its great sporting facilities, the first MBAT was a monumental atmosphere in which MBA students, partners and friends competed intensely during the day, then enjoyed the spoils of Le Crédit Lyonnais and other sponsorship bounties by night. </p>

                    <h2 class="section-title wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s">The Participating Schools Were:</h2>

                    <ul class="stylish-list mb-3">
                        <li>Manchester Business School (Winner of MBAT'91)</li>
                        <li>Cranfield School of Management (Winner of '91 MBAT Spirit Award)</li>
                        <li>London Business School</li>
                        <li>INSEAD (last-minute scratch for exams...?)</li>
                        <li>SDA Bocconi</li>
                        <li>Rotterdam School of Management</li>
                        <li>HEC Group</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="wow fadeInDown" data-wow-delay="0.2s">The MBAT has since grown. The present day MBAT attracts over 1500 participants from 15 of the top European business schools representing over 70 nationalities. </p>

The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.</p>
