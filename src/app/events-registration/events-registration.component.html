        <p>At station two, the player must do a layup, if the player misses the shot he will need to get the ball by himself/herself and do the layup again, until the ball goes in.</p>

        <p>At station three, the player must do a spin dribble at each cone, alternating the orientation of the rotation in each move.</p>

        <p>At station four, the player must make a 3-point shot, a helper can be inside the court to help retrieve the ball if the player misses and extra balls can be positioned along the baseline and the 3-point line.</p>

        <p><b>Format:</b> Live online</p>

        <p>Knockout battle competition format with eight (8) or 16 participants; if number of participants is between 8-16 or >16, then a qualification stage is taking place to choose the top 8 or 16 performers. Each performer is competing against one other on every knockout stage.</p>

        <p>Each participant must take a 1-minute live performance and they can use their own ball (ball of size 5 is preferable choice, nevertheless there is tolerance of 0.5 both ways); it is strictly prohibited to use more than one (1) ball in the performance and no modifications to ball is allowed.</p>

        <p>Regarding general rules, hands are not allowed, and every use of hand is considered as mistake (by hand understand “from shoulders to end of fingers”); foreign objects cannot be integrated into the performance (e.g. bottles, rope, etc.); no other people can be brought into the performance; dropped ball after trick attempt is not considered as anything else than drop; any action after the time limit does not count into the performance, however if the ball is dropped it is considered as mistake; and no outside interference in holding the ball to body (e.g. glue, tape, laces, etc.)</p>

        <p>Each performance will be evaluated in five (5) main categories, all equally weighted: difficulty, all-round, originality, execution and control. The winner is determined by the performer who gets the greatest number of points on the scoreboard when all points are summed up. If the performers get equal number of points, the performer who won the most criteria win the battle. If there is still a tie, there will be an extra round each. The extra round will be judged the same way as a normal performance, but with 30 seconds for each performance.</p>

        <p>The general guidelines for giving scores are as follows:</p>

        <ul> 
          <li>5 – Excellent</li>
          <li>4 – Very good</li>
          <li>3 – Good</li>
          <li>2 – Fair</li>
          <li>1 – Poor</li>
          <li>0 – Absolutely failed</li>
        </ul>

        <p>It is also possible to give 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5 points if the performance for a player was somewhere between the scores mentioned above. The point-giving must be given based on the main criteria and the sub-criteria. The criteria and sub-criteria are:</p>

        <ul>  
                
          <li>Difficulty (technical difficulty of the tricks and combinations, as well as response) <br>
          -Overall performance – how difficult full performance generally is
          </li>

          <li>All-round (general ability to perform all parts of sport the best way possible) <br>
          -The sum of the general level in uppers, lowers, sit-downs, transitions, acrobatics and ground moves
          </li>

          <li>Originality (performing with individual style, creativity and variety) <br>
          -Original style – original composition of tricks, unique execution of moves <br>
          -Original moves – new, unusual, unexpected tricks <br>
          -Variety – ability to not repeat tricks or always tricks of the same kind
          </li>

          <li>Execution (the style performance with ball is executed) <br>
          -Cleanness – clean execution of tricks <br>
          -Flow – ability to move the ball around body without hesitation <br>
          -Style – how good looking the tricks are being performed <br>
          -Dynamics – strength and speed of movements <br>
          -Musicality – hitting the beat or clearly shows that he/she is following the music 
          </li>

          <li>Control (the way the whole performance with the ball is controlled) <br>
          -Control – general control of the ball  <br>
          -Mistakes – dropping the ball or creating mistakes
          </li>

        <p><b>Format:</b> Group challenge.</p>

        <p>This competition will be monitored via the Strava app. Competitors will be required to sign up to this challenge specifically and they will be allocated to groups. Each school will have a group on Strava where they will be logging in their runs. Only runs with GPS tracking will be counted to the total tally. Runs must be tracked by an official running tracker e.g., smart watch, Strava, Nike Run Club, Garmin… No subscription for any app is mandatory, free versions are enough for the challenge.</p> 

        <p><b>Timing:</b></p>

        <p>This challenge will be from 29th of April 00:00 until 5th of May 23:59 Paris time. Only runs between these dates will be counted towards the total group score.</p>

        <p><b>Scoring:</b></p>

        <p>Scoring will be based on three factors. For each participating school, and therefore group, the total distance logged will be the first scoring factor. The number of participants will be the second factor for scoring. And last, in order to accommodate for smaller batch sizes, a factoring of MBAs per school will be taken into consideration. Note that the last factor is about batch sizes in schools and not only MBAT participants.</p>

        <p><b>Format:</b> Live online</p>

        <p><b>Required equipment:</b> Treadmill.</p>

        <p>This challenge will be a live treadmill run. Participants are required to run for 30 min on a treadmill. The scoring will be based on the distance logged at the end of the 30 min. Grade/Inclination is mandatory at 2.0 throughout the run.</p>

        <p>The running challenge will be monitored on zoom. For this challenge, two cameras per participant might be required. The Monitor will require a full vision of the participant at all time and at the treadmill’s screen. The first camera needs to show a wide enough view to make sure the participant is running and that the participant is not being aided by anyone. This view should also show the second camera (equipment not the feed) at all time. The second camera is required to view the treadmill’s screen. This camera needs to start at a position where we see the participant and then move into the location where it films the screen of the treadmill for the whole run. Any glitches can be deemed cheating and could lead to disqualification.</p>

        <p>Compliance of regional COVID-19 safety rules is mandatory.</p>
